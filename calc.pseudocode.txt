Make variable named entries equals to an empty array
  Make variable named total equals to zero
Make variable named temp equals to empty string


Create function for when event of click happens to object with the ID of button
Create variable named val equalling the value of the button that is clicked on

If val is number or equal to “.” add it to temp variable
Else, if value equals AC empty the entries array, temp variable to empty string and total variable to 0
Else, if value equals CE reset temp variable back to an empty string to clear last entry
Else, if value equals x push temp and * (multiply symbol) to entries array and temp to an empty string  
Else, if value equals ÷ push temp and / (division symbol) to entries array and temp to an empty string
Else if value equals = push temp to entries array
	Make new variable named nt which equals number of entries in entries array

	Make loop to go through the total length of the entries array and perform the calculations 	accordingly with entries inputted into the array
		if symbol equals + add next number to nt
		else, if symbol equals - minus next number to nt
		else, if symbol equals * multiply nt by next number
		else, if symbol equals / divide nt by the next number

Push the value of nt to the answer id
Reset entries array to empty 
Reset temp string to empty
